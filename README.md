# DescriptiveGeometry

This project aims to provide an integrated environment for solving complex descriptive geometry tasks.

Descriptive geometry involves the visual representation and analysis of 3-dimensional objects and their spatial relationships. We offer a user-friendly web interface where users can input their geometry tasks and receive step-by-step solutions. The system utilizes advanced algorithms and mathematical models to accurately solve complex problems. It also includes features for visualizing the geometry tasks and their solutions, making it easier for users to understand and verify the results.

This project is designed for students, professionals, and anyone interested in exploring and solving intricate descriptive geometry problems.
